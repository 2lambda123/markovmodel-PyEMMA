Learn PyEMMA
============

We provide two major sources of learning materials to master PyEMMA, our collection of Jupyter notebook tutorials and
videos of talks given at our annually workshop.

The notebook are a collection of complete application walk throughs capturing the most important aspects in building and
analyzing a Markov state model.


Jupyter notebook tutorials
--------------------------

 .. _ref-notebooks:

By means of three different application examples, these notebooks give an overview of following methods:

   * Featurization and MD trajectory input
   * Time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA)
   * Clustering
   * Markov state model (MSM) estimation and validation
   * Computing Metastable states and structures, coarse-grained MSMs
   * Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
   * Transition Path Theory (TPT)

These tutorials are part of a LiveCOMS journal article and are up to date with the state of the
released version of PyEMMA.

You can find the article right `here <https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5965-introduction-to-markov-state-modeling-with-the-pyemma-software-article-v1-0>`_.

If you should find a mistake or have suggestions improving parts of the tutorial, you can file issues and pull requests
for the contents of both the article and the jupyter notebooks `here <https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA_tutorials>`_.

Workshop video tutorials
------------------------

On our Youtube channel you will find lectures and talks about:

  * Markov model state theory
  * Hidden Markov state models
  * Transition path theory
  * Enhanced sampling
  * dealing with multi-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations in PyEMMA
  * useful hints about practical issues...
