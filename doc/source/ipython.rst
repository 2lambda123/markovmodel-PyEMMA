IPython Notebook Tutorials
==========================

These IPython (http://ipython.org) notebooks show the usage of the PyEMMA API in
action and also describe the workflow of Markov model building.


You can obtain a copy of all notebooks and most of the used data
`here <https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA_IPython/archive/devel.zip>`_.
Note that the trajectory of the D.E. Shaw BPTI simulation trajectory is not included
in this archive, since we're not permitted to share this data. Thus the corresponding
notebooks can't be run without obtaining the simulation trajectory independently.
