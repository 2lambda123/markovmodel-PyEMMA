* (pystallone) recover code to handle python lists as array

* pre cythonized files blow up repo (ugly merge conflicts) - if we just require
  cython in a source install and ship binary packages for users too stupid to 
  provide a sane env, we can just preserve the use of complicated workarounds.
  -> require a stable appveyor build for win
  -> require a stable build for travis (first available when travis provides more mac builders)

  provide binaries:
    for emma, pystallone, jpype:
    write conda recipes for all
  
*  pypi stallone: issue with source install (and old setuptools?)

* remove output cells of ipython notebooks and unify their history (we do not want to track output).

* machbarkeit modular system?
    * module system (msm package, autobuilder etc) mit eigener versions nr, 
      setup.py, folder.

* monkey patch scipy (0.11) eye method to have default argument for second param!
   scipy.sparse.eye(m, n, k=0, dtype='d', format=None)[source] ==>
   scipy.sparse.eye(m, n=None, k=0, dtype='d', format=None)[source]Â¶

final steps:
* packaging (provide wheels)
* move repo to github
* split ipynbs into own repo


future:
-------
* pytables (hdf) project format?
* pymol/vmd vis support (abstraction layer?)
